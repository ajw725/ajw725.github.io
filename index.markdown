Hello! Welcome to my blog.

My name is Andrew. I'm a software engineer based in Boulder, CO. When I'm not writing code, I do all the same things as everyone else in Boulder - run, bike, ski, hike, etc. I also like to read and play music. I do not particularly like to write about myself.

Please see the [FAQ](/about) for answers to all of life's questions.

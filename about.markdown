### What do you know about software?

People kept stubbing their toes on hardware, so they started making it softer.

### Ok, dad.

Yeah, I get that a lot.

### So...?

I'm most experienced with Ruby/Rails (and some Sinatra), but I've been fairly immersed in JavaScript (React, TypeScript, NestJS) recently at work. I've also done a lot of development on the Salesforce platform, and I know my way around a decent chunk of AWS. I'm comfortable writing SQL queries, bash scripts, or figuring out whatever other tools I might need for the job at hand, and I always enjoy learning new things.

### Why did you start a blog?

See [here]({% post_url 2020-12-03-what-is-this-for %}).

### Why is your favicon Sherlock Hemlock?

I like solving problems, and I like to think of myself as a detective when I'm debugging code. I'm not arrogant enough to think of myself as Sherlock Holmes, though, and I loved Sesame Street when I was a kid. So Sherlock Hemlock it is.

### What's with the title? Are you a hacker?

Yes, and you can be, too!

Ok, probably not in the way you mean. But [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker) defines a "hacker" as "a computer expert who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means."

### How frequently are these questions actually asked?

At least once, by me, to myself, when I created this page.

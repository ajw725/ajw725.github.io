### Who the heck are you?

My name is Andrew. I'm a software engineer based in Boulder, CO. When I'm not writing code, I do all the same things as everyone else in Boulder - run, bike, ski, hike, etc. I also like to read and play music. I do not like to write "about me" sections.

### What do you know about software?

People kept stubbing their toes on hardware, so they started making it softer.

### Ok, dad.

Yeah, I get that a lot.

### So...software?

I'm most experienced with Ruby/Rails (and some Sinatra), but I've been fairly immersed in JavaScript (React, TypeScript, NestJS) recently at work. I've also done a lot of development on the Salesforce platform, and I know my way around a decent chunk of AWS. I'm comfortable writing SQL queries, bash scripts, or figuring out whatever other tools I might need for the job at hand, and I always enjoy learning new things.

### How frequently are these questions actually asked?

At least once, by me, to myself, when I created this page.

### Why is your favicon Sherlock Hemlock?

I like solving problems, and I like to think of myself as a detective when I'm debugging code. I'm not arrogant enough to think of myself as Sherlock Holmes, though, and I loved Sesame Street when I was a kid. So Sherlock Hemlock it is.
